Welcome to my SQL repository. In this repo I will be updating all the exercises I did corresponding to the subject 'Databases 1'. <br>
It's a subject taught in the National University of La Matanza, where I am in my fourth year of Software Engineering career. So far, I've learned about databases design, things like ERD, Normalization, Relational Model, and more. <br>
Now, It's time to practice :)
