<h1>SQL - UNLAM 2023 </h1> <br>
Welcome to my SQL repository. In this repo I will be updating all the exercises I did corresponding to the subject 'Databases 1'. <br>
It's a subject taught in the National University of La Matanza, where I am in my fourth year of Software Engineering career. So far, I've learned about databases design, things like ERD, Normalization, Relational Model, and more. <br>
Now, It's time to practice :)

Update:
The course has just ended and I learned a lot of things that made me think different and helped me to understand SQL very well.
I'm writing the list of learned topics below:

DDL: Create, Alter, Drop
DML: Select, Update, Delete, Insert
DCL: Revoke, Grant, Deny

Joins: Inner, Left, Right, Cross, Full

Aggregate Functions: MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM, COUNT.
GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
DIVISION

Objects: VIEWS, FUNCTION, STORE PROCEDURE, TRIGGERS.
